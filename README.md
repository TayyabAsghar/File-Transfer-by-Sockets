## File Transfer Via Python Sockets

- First install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your system.
- Create file named `server-file.txt` and write the text you want to send.
- Open a terminal and run python `server.py` to initiate the server.
- Open another terminal and run python `client.py` to start the client.
- As soon as the connection from the client is established the file will be transferred to the client by the name of `client-file.txt`.
